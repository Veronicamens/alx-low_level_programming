0x08. C - Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique that involves a function calling itself
to solve a problem. In C programming language, recursion can be used to solve
complex problems efficiently. Recursion can be implemented using base cases and
recursive calls. It's important to use recursion judiciously, as it can be
memory-intensive and may lead to stack overflow errors if the function
calls itself too many times.
