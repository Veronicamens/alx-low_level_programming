This README file provides a brief overview of C File I/O, covering the basics
of reading from and writing to files in the C programming language.
It explains the main concepts, functions, and techniques used
for file input/output operations in C.

Introduction:
File I/O (Input/Output) operations are essential for handling data stored in
files. C provides a set of functions and techniques to perform file I/O
operations, enabling programmers to read data from files or write data
to files.
Key Concepts:

File Pointers: In C, a file is represented by a file pointer, which serves
as a reference to the file being accessed. File pointers are used to perform
various operations, such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
Opening a File: Before performing any operations on a file, it needs to be
opened using the fopen() function. Opening a file involves specifying the
file name and the mode of access (e.g., read, write, append).
Reading from a File: To read data from a file, C provides functions like
fgetc() (read a single character), fgets() (read a line of text), and fscanf()
(read formatted data).
These functions allow retrieving data from a file for further processing.
Writing to a File: C provides functions such as fputc()
(write a single character), fputs() (write a string), and fprintf()
(write formatted data) to write data to a file. These functions enable
storing data in a file for later retrieval or sharing.
Closing a File: After performing all necessary operations, it is crucial to
close the file using the fclose() function. Closing a file ensures that any
changes made are saved and releases system resources associated with the file.
Error Handling: When working with files, it is essential to handle potential
errors. Functions like feof() (checks for the end of file), ferror()
(checks for file errors), and perror() (prints error messages)
aid in error detection and handling.

Usage:
To use the file I/O functions in a C program, include the <stdio.h> header
file. Open the desired file using fopen(), perform the necessary read or
write operations, and close the file using fclose() when finished.

Conclusion:
C File I/O is a fundamental aspect of programming, allowing reading from and
writing to files. Understanding the concepts and functions related to
file I/O in C enables developers to handle file operations efficiently,
facilitating data manipulation and storage.
