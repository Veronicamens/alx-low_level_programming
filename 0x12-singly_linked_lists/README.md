Singly Linked Lists
This project is a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C. A singly
linked list is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, each of
which contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node
is called the tail.

The project includes the following files:

list.h: This file contains the declaration of the list_t struct, which
represents a node in the linked list.
list.c: This file contains the implementation of the list_t struct,
as well as functions for creating, adding, removing, and printing linked lists.
main.c: This file contains the main function, which creates a linked list,
adds some elements to it, and then prints the list.
