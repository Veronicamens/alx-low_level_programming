C - Structures, typedef
the concepts of structures and typedef in C are powerful tools for organizing
and manipulating complex data. Structures allow you to create user-defined data
types with multiple variables, while typedef provides a way to define new names
for existing data types. These concepts are essential in writing efficient,
modular, and readable code in C.
