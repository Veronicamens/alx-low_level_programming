C - More pointers, arrays, and strings is an advanced topic in the
C programming language that builds on the fundamental concepts of pointers,
arrays, and strings. This topic covers more complex techniques and applications
for these concepts, such as multi-dimensional arrays, pointer arithmetic,
dynamic memory allocation, and manipulation of strings. Understanding these
concepts is essential for writing efficient and effective C programs,
especially those that involve data structures and algorithms.
