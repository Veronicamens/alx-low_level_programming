C - Function pointers are variables that hold the memory addresses of functions
in the C programming language. They allow functions to be treated as data and
provide flexibility in programming. Function pointers can be used to pass
functions as arguments, store functions in data structures, implement dynamic
dispatch, and create function-based interfaces. They enhance code modularity
and reusability. However, careful attention must be given to syntax and type
matching when working with function pointers.
