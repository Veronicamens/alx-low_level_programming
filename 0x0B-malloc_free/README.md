# C - malloc, free

This repository contains examples of using `malloc` and `free` in C programming
language for dynamic memory allocation.

## Introduction

In C, dynamic memory allocation is performed using the `malloc` function, which
stands for memory allocation. It allows you to dynamically allocate memory at
runtime, based on the size specified. `malloc` is used to allocate a block of
memory and returns a pointer to the beginning of that block.

Once you are done using the dynamically allocated memory, it is important to
free that memory to avoid memory leaks. The `free` function is used to
deallocate the memory previously allocated using `malloc`.
